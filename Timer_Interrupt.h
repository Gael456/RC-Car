 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the system clock's frequency is 50 MHz.

 * to view the Vector Number, Interrupt Request (IRQ) Number, and the Vector Address
 * for each peripheral.

 * @brief Initializes the Timer 0A peripheral to generate periodic interrupts.
 *
 * This function initializes the Timer 1A peripheral to generate periodic interrupts for executing a user-defined task.
 * It configures Timer 0A with a 1 ms interval using the 50MHz system clock source.
 * The provided task function will be executed whenever Timer 0A generates an interrupt.
 * The priority level is set to 1.
 *
 * @param task A pointer to the user-defined function to be executed upon Timer 0A interrupt.

/**
 * @brief The interrupt service routine (ISR) for Timer 0A.
 *
 * This function is the interrupt service routine (ISR) for the Timer 0A peripheral.
 * It checks the Timer 0A time-out interrupt flag and executes the user-defined task function if the flag is set.
 * After executing the task function, it acknowledges the Timer 0A interrupt and clears it.
 *
 * @param None

 * @return None
